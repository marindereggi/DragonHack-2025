## AI-Powered Suturing Feedback for Medical Students

StitchMaster is an innovative application designed specifically for medical students honing their suturing techniques. As future surgeons, developing precise suturing skills is critical for successful patient outcomes, requiring detailed and consistent feedback.

### Overview

While universities provide evaluation from trained professionals, StitchMaster brings this essential feedback into students' homes. The application employs advanced computer vision technology to analyze uploaded images of suturing work.

### How It Works

1. Students complete a practice suturing session
2. They photograph their sutures and upload them to the app
3. StitchMaster automatically detects individual stitches
4. The app evaluates sutures across multiple parameters:
   - Quantity
   - Angle
   - Length
   - Overall consistency

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Advanced computer vision algorithms detect and evaluate suturing work
- **Personalized Feedback**: Integrated chatbot delivers tailored assessments, explaining specific mistakes or offering praise
- **Interactive Learning**: Students can engage with the chatbot for additional tips, clarification, or reassurance
- **Progress Tracking**: Complete history of all submitted work allows students to visualize improvement over time
- **Closed-Loop Learning**: System accelerates skill development by providing immediate, objective feedback outside the classroom

StitchMaster prepares medical students for clinical rotations by enabling more frequent, guided practice sessions. This builds the confidence and precision required for surgical excellence.

StitchMaster is an innovative application designed specifically for medical students honing their suturing techniques. As future surgeons, developing precise suturing skills is critical for successful patient outcomes, requiring detailed and consistent feedback. While universities provide evaluation from trained professionals, StitchMaster brings this essential feedback into students' homes.
The application employs advanced computer vision technology to analyze uploaded images of suturing work. When a student completes a practice session, they simply photograph their sutures and upload them to the app. StitchMaster automatically detects individual stitches, marking them on the image and evaluating them across multiple parameters including quantity, angle, length, and overall consistency.
What sets StitchMaster apart is its comprehensive feedback loop. An integrated chatbot delivers personalized assessments, explaining specific mistakes or offering praise for well-executed techniques. Students can engage with the chatbot for additional tips, clarification, or reassurance about their progress.
The platform maintains a complete history of all submitted work, allowing students to track their improvement over time through visual comparisons and scoring trends. This longitudinal view reinforces learning and motivates continuous practice.
StitchMaster creates a closed-loop learning system that accelerates skill development, builds confidence, and prepares medical students for clinical rotations. By providing immediate, objective feedback outside the classroom environment, students can practice more frequently with meaningful guidance, ultimately developing the precision required for surgical excellence.
